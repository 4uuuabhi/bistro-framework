		server tag controls server restart and location of configuration files. 
		
		Attribute restart can have one of 3 values "auto", "manual", or "disabled"
		"auto" means that every time when a watcher reports that a config file is updated, the server 
		reloads the workflow definition and restarts the application.
		"manual" means that every time when this configuration file is updated the server reloads the
		workflow definition and restarts the application.
		"disabled" means that the server reloads the workflow definition and checks it for errors but 
		does not start the application. An attempt to access any page of the application produces a page
		with the text specified in the inactive subtag of the server tag
		When this configuration file is updated the value of the restart attribute affects the server 
		status as follows:
		  
		  Old       New      Action
		 value     value     
		 auto      auto       None 
		 auto      manual     Disables watchers
		 auto      disabled   Stops the server and disables the watchers
		 manual    auto       Enables the watchers
		 manual    manual     None
		 manual    disabled   Stops the server.
		 disabled  auto       Loads the workflow definition, starts the server and enables the watchers
		 disabled  manual     Loads the workflow definition and starts the server
		 disabled  disabled   None
